# dotfiles
My config/dotfiles.

I use these on a Debian/Ubuntu computer. Currently sets up
zsh, vim, tmux, and a few other small things (mutt, python,
git, i3).

Running `makeitso` will put most things in place, and suggest
other actions that might be needed.

## TODO

- vimrc: vundle stuff
- muttrc?
- script to install all of them
- really test it
